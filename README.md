# TimelapseSoundtrack
A program that takes a video as an imput and exports a midi file that audiates each frame of the input

Note : 10/01/2020
  I have always loved doing timelapse photography but I usually have no accompanying music to go with them.
  This app is an attempt to fill that void by taking each frame of an input video and finding a unique combination of musical notes that can be played together
  during that frame of the video. The project is unfinished as of 10/01/2020.
